# Oscillator Metronome

**Oscillator Metronome** is a MIDI device that functions as a dynamic metronome. Unlike a standard metronome, it accelerates and decelerates between two user-defined points, allowing for evolving rhythmic tempos and experimental timing in your compositions or live performances.
The device can be used to explore unconventional rhythmic grooves, gradual tempo changes, and polyrhythmic interactions when combined with other MIDI instruments or devices.
The device should be placed on a MIDI track before any instrument or drum device.


## Features
- Gradually accelerates and decelerates between two tempo points
- Works with Ableton Live’s MIDI tracks and instruments
- Ideal for experimental grooves, polyrhythms, and tempo modulation
- Fully adjustable start and end tempo values
- Simple and intuitive interface for live performance or composition
